    The Moon is Earth's only natural satellite. It orbits at an average distance of 384,400 km, about 30 times the diameter
    of Earth. Tidal forces between Earth and the Moon have synchronized the Moon's orbital period with its rotation period
    at 29.5 Earth days, causing the same side of the Moon to always face Earth.

<p>
    A planet is a celestial body that (a) is in orbit around the Sun, (b) has sufficient mass for its self-gravity to
    overcome rigid body forces so that it assumes a hydrostatic equilibrium (nearly round) shape, and (c) has cleared the
    neighborhood around its orbit.

<p>
    Stars are giant balls of hot gas â€“ mostly hydrogen, with some helium and small amounts of other elements. Every star has
    its own life cycle, ranging from a few million to trillions of years, and its properties change as it ages.
